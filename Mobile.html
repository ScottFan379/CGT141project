                <p><img src="pics/candycrush.png">Since its debut in April 2012 and its high peak soon after, the craze of Candy Crush has somewhat toned down for all but one

                available on multiple platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and social media platforms like Facebook. This accessibility, combined 
                with its free-to-play model, makes it easy for players to dive into the game and enjoy a quick gaming session anytime, anywhere. The

            <h2 class="title2">Genshin Impact’s issue with representation</h2>
            <p><img src="pics/genshin.jpg">Genshin Impact, a popular action role-playing game developed by miHoYo, has garnered widespread acclaim for its stunning open-world 
                design, engaging storyline, and diverse cast of characters. However, like many other online gaming communities, Genshin Impact has 
                not been immune to instances of racism and discrimination among players. The game's expansive player base, comprising individuals 
                from various cultural backgrounds, can sometimes lead to conflicts and instances of discriminatory behavior.
                Instances of racism in Genshin Impact often manifest in the form of offensive language, derogatory comments, or exclusionary behavior 
                directed towards players based on their nationality, ethnicity, or language preferences. The game's global appeal, with players from 
                different parts of the world interacting in a shared virtual space, highlights the need for cultural sensitivity and mutual respect 
                within the gaming community. Developers have implemented reporting mechanisms and moderation systems to address instances of racism, 
                but the challenge persists in fostering a truly inclusive and welcoming gaming environment.
                To combat racism in Genshin Impact, the community has taken initiatives to promote awareness and education. Players have organized 
                discussions, events, and campaigns to encourage tolerance and understanding among the player base. Additionally, miHoYo has a 
                responsibility to continuously update and refine its moderation tools to swiftly address reports of racism, fostering an atmosphere 
                where players feel safe and respected regardless of their background. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, addressing issues
                of racism within virtual worlds like Genshin Impact becomes crucial for creating an environment that reflects the diverse and 
                inclusive nature of its player base.
